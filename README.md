## General info

Hand Things Over is a website with a simple form that will make it easier for users to donate items.
The aim of this project is to create a place where everyone can donate unnecessary things to trusted institutions.

## Source
This project is based on prototype "Oddam w dobre rƒôce" prepared by Magda - graduate of Coders Lab UX course.

## Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - for styles
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - for routing
* [React Scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll) -  for animating vertical scrolling
* [React App Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) and [Customize-CRA](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra) - to override create-react-app webpack configs without ejecting
* [React Visibility Sensor](https://github.com/joshwnj/react-visibility-sensor) - Sensor component for React that notifies you when it goes in or out of the window viewport
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - authentication with email address and password

## Setup
